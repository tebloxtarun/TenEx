### Uniswap Tokenomics
1. **Exchange Pools**:
   - Each ERC-20 token has a dedicated exchange holding reserves of ETH and the token.
   - Liquidity providers add assets to these pools.

2. **Liquidity Provision**:
   - Providers earn a 0.3% fee on trades.
   - Fees are distributed proportionally among liquidity providers.

3. **Automated Market Making**:
   - Uses the constant product formula ( x * y = k ).
   - Prices adjust automatically based on reserves.

4. **Trading Mechanism**:
   - Users trade directly against the reserves.
   - No order matching needed; prices are algorithmically determined.

5. **ETH as Common Pair**:
   - ETH is the intermediary for ERC-20 to ERC-20 trades.
   - Trades involve two steps: ERC-20 to ETH, then ETH to ERC-20.

6. **Pricing Calculations**:
