| Distribution     | Airdrops, liquidity mining rewards, strategic partnerships                                                                                                   |
| Utility          | Governance, liquidity provision, fee accrual                                                                                                                 |
| Liquidity Mining | Users can earn UNI tokens by providing liquidity to specific token pairs on Uniswap V2. Liquidity providers receive a portion of trading fees and UNI rewards. |
| Fee Structure    | Uniswap V2 charges a 0.3% trading fee on each transaction, distributed to liquidity providers. UNI holders can propose changes to the fee structure.       |
| Governance       | UNI holders have voting rights in the governance of the protocol. Each UNI token represents one vote.                                                         |
| Decentralization| Operates on-chain through smart contracts with no central authority. Governance process open to UNI token holders for community-driven decision-making.     |

# MATHAMATICS

| Mathematical Concept  | Description                                                                                                        |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Constant Product Formula | (x*y = k\), where \(x\) and \(y\) are the quantities of two different tokens in a liquidity pool, and \(k\) is a constant value. |
| Price Calculation | Price = y/x, where \(x\) and \(y\) are the quantities of the two tokens in the liquidity pool. |
| Trading | When a trade occurs, the constant product formula ensures that the product of the quantities of the two tokens remains constant. |
| Fee Calculation | Fee = Trade Amount*Fee Rate, where the fee rate is typically 0.3%.               |
